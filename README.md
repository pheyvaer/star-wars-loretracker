# Star Wars Loretracker

[Star Wars Loretracker](https://star-wars-loretracker.vercel.app/) is a tool for Star Wars fans to track which books and comics they've read, and which movies and series they've watched.

I began my journey into the Star Wars expanded universe in the beginning of 2022. Reading book after book and realizing just how vast the entire Star Wars publication list is, I felt I need a way to visually see which books I finished and which ones remain.

Fortunately the amazing [Youtini Team](https://youtini.com) has already assembled a gigantic database of all the Star Wars books and comics ever published, so all I had to do was to develop an interface to browse and filter the gargantuan collection.
